# Environment Variable Roulette

Debug 'works on my machine' issues by comparing environment variables across systems. Save one environment as reference, then see how everyone else's setup differs. Because debugging should feel exciting!

Run: `./env-roulette.sh` to compare, or `./env-roulette.sh save` to save your environment.
